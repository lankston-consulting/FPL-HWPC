The recalcitrance of carbon in harvested wood products is highly dependent upon the end use of those products. The carbon remaining in the end-use products in use pool in a given inventory year includes products in use and recovered products.",

Carbon in dumps include discarded wood and paper products and comprise a portion of the solid waste disposal site pool.

Carbon emitted from burning fuelwood and wood waste with energy capture occurs during the year of harvest and is not assumed to substitute for an equivalent amount of fossil fuel carbon. Carbon emissions are displayed in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and do not include other carbon-based greenhouse gases such as methane.",

  "3": "Figure 3. The annual net change in total ppd harvested wood products carbon stocks, in metric tons, from 1906 to 2018. The gray line displays the net change in carbon stocks, which is the sum of solid waste disposal sites (SWDS - orange bar) and products in use (blue bar). The orange and blue bars represent the stock change from the previous year; negative values indicate that the carbon in the pools are shrinking, while positive values indicate that the pools are growing."
